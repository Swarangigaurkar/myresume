* Utilized Arduino UNO as edge device for Condition Based Monitoring, trained LSTM model on factors like vibration,
power consumption, resulting in a 30% reduction in machine downtime
* Analyzed time series datasets to predict the RUL and predict faults 7 days in advance with 94% accuracy using Random Forest algorithms
* Published the research paper in International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology 2021
